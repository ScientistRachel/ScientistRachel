## ðŸ‘‹ Hello from @ScientistRachel aka Rachel Lee

:microscope: I am the Bioimage Analysis Lead at the [Advanced Imaging Center](https://www.aicjanelia.org/) on the [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/).  [@aicjanelia](https://github.com/aicjanelia) makes cutting-edge imaging technology available to users worldwide.  My job is to help users develop informative experiments, process raw microscopy data into functional images, create impactful visualizations, and extract hypothesis-driven results from their images.
 
:woman_scientist: My repositories here are a mix of projects across my career.  Prior to working at the AIC, I was a postdoc studying breast cancer metastasis with [Dr. Stuart Martin](https://ssmartinlab.org/) at the Univeristy of Maryland School of Medicine.  I received my PhD in physics while working with [Dr. Wolfgang Losert](http://losertlab.ireap.umd.edu/) on projects related to collective cell migration and other dynamic biological systems (see also [@losertlab](https://github.com/losertlab)).  Learn more on [my personal website](http://www.scientistrachel.com/).
